# Internet-Engineering-Project4
Advanced middleware in Express

In the first phase(Internet-Engineering-Project3), we built a complete and secure API based on Express, including an MVC structure, basic middleware (logging, authentication, rate-limiting, and error handling). In the second phase, we need to upgrade this system to the Production Level. This is done using professional middleware such as CORS, Helmet, Morgan, Compression, and Express Validator.
